# Acknowledgements
This is a hopefully exhaustive list of all the tools used to build the API and the clients. Where appropriate, individual acknowledgements for sections of code which have been used from online fora, such as (Stackoverflow)[https://stackoverflow.com/] where those have been critical to the projects. It is a growing list and contributors will be added as time goes by.

In general we have avoided using 3rd party libraries where possible, and where we have, we have chosen only those which are mature and well-maintained by an active github community. We hope in time, if we can earn the respect and trust of our own community of electronic growth chart enthusiasts, that this project will join the ranks of those well-respected and authoritative repositories.
