# DEPRECATED Clinical Advice strings for Centile results

This information has been included in the docs but is no longer actively maintained and is left for informational reasons only reasons. The dGC Project Board decided that supplying advice on individual growth points was unhelpful and asked that this function be deprecated.

## Background

As part of commissioning for the RCPCH charts, a stipulation was made that the API not only provide accurate and reliable SDS and centiles for measurements of children, but some contextual advice be also reported, tailored to the user. This is contraversial, as interpretation of growth data can only be made understanding a child's context and their growth history. Advice therefore is reported as follows, as MVP (minimum viable product) currently does not consider multiple data points at the current time, though plans are in place in future for this to be possible.
