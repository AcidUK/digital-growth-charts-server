# Calculating Growth Parameters - WIP

use this page to document the gotchas and difficulties that arise when doing Centiles etc in code  
clinico-statistical centiles gotchas that we've had to work through

* term dates averaging
* age thresholds for different measurements begin and end at different ages

allude to other packages that do centiles, and why this one may be more accurate - we had access to Tim Cole for detailed consultation on how to best implement the calculations.....
