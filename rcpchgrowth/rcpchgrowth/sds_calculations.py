Defaults to the youngest reference unless the user selects false
    born_preterm (boolean): defaults to False. If a baby is 37-42 weeks, use the uk_who_0_20_term data by default. If a baby was born preterm, the UK90 gestation specific data is used up to 42 weeks

    This function is specific to the UK-WHO data set as this is actually a blend of UK-90 and WHO 2006 references and necessarily has duplicate values.

    SDS is generated by passing the interpolated L, M and S values for age through an equation.
    Cubic interpolation is used for most values, but where ages of children are at the extremes of the growth reference,
    linear interpolation is used instead. These are:
    1. 23 weeks gestation
    2. 42 weeks gestation or 2 weeks post term delivery - the reference data here changes from UK90 to WHO 2006
    3. 2 years - children at this age stop being measured lying down and are instead measured standing, leading to a small decrease
    4. 4 years - the reference data here changes back to UK90 data
    5. 20 years - the threshold of the reference data

    Other considerations
     - Length data is not available until 25 weeks gestation, though weight date is available from 23 weeks
     - There is only BMI reference data from 2 weeks of age to aged 20y
     - Head circumference reference data is available from 23 weeks gestation to 17y in girls and 18y in boys
